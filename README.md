# OmniView Product Vision

## Introduction
OmniView is an ambitious open-source project aimed at creating an omniscient data-visualization and analysis tool. It is designed to work with a variety of data producers and analysis tools without needing to know about them at compile-time. This modular and flexible approach ensures that OmniView can adapt to a wide range of data formats and analysis methodologies.
