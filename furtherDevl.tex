\chapter[Further Devl]{Further Development of OmniView}
OmniView as it is right now has a limited shelf-life. 
The current version will be deprecated somewhere around summer of 2024.
It will be replaced by a more modular approach, that consists of two separate pieces, called OmniDaemon and OmniView 2.0.
OmniView 2.0 will be written in Angular.
OmniDaemon will still be written in C++ and use the same approach for data-acquisition. 
The interprocess-communication between the data and the view on the data will be implemented by using websockets for live-streaming, REST for settings and downloading whole files and MQTT-Publishing for sending out alarms and similar fire-and-forget messages.
